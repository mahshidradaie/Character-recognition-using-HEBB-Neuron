Developed and trained a custom multi-layer neural network in MATLAB to recognize hand-drawn characters using supervised learning techniques.
•	Built a dataset of character patterns (e.g., digits and letters) represented as binary pixel matrices, simulating low-resolution handwriting input.
•	Implemented a flexible neural network framework capable of handling multiple layers and varying numbers of neurons per layer.
•	Trained the network on different character sets and evaluated its ability to generalize and distinguish among multiple input patterns.
•	Explored the impact of different hyperparameters (e.g., number of hidden neurons, layer count, learning rate, and weight initialization) on classification accuracy.
•	Conducted experiments with noisy input patterns and similar-looking character classes to evaluate robustness and recognition reliability.
•	Visualized learning curves and network weights to better understand feature learning and convergence behavior.
